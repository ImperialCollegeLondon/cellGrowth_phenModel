## functioning
The functioning of the scripts is described in the aforementioned thesis. A link to the text will be provided as soon it is available.

## notes
Currently, the optimization function exports all matrices produced during optimization. While it is helpful for analysing how the process worked, it can become very costly in terms of allocated memory (up to the point the system might crash).
The alpha folder contains a newer (but still untested) version of the script that only employs and exports the last two rounds of the optimization process.
